# 📱 Messenger App (Jetpack Compose)

A simple messenger application built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.
This project was created as part of an intensive Android learning process with focus on **modern Android architecture** and **UI development**.

## 🏗 Architecture

The app follows a simplified **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:

* **UI (Jetpack Compose)**
  Stateless composables that receive data and callbacks

* **ViewModel**
  Handles state, business logic, and UI updates

* **State Management**
  Uses `mutableStateOf` and `mutableStateListOf` for reactive UI

---

## 🔄 State Management

* Single source of truth (SSOT) via `UiState`
* State hoisting (UI does not own state)
* Immutable updates using `copy()`

Example:

```kotlin
uiState = uiState.copy(
    contacts = updatedList
)
```

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Practiced

* Jetpack Compose basics (LazyColumn, TextField, Buttons)
* Navigation with arguments
* State management in Compose
* ViewModel lifecycle
* Coroutines (`viewModelScope`, `launch`, `delay`)
* Clean UI separation (UI vs logic)
* Event-driven architecture

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Kotlin**
* **Jetpack Compose**
* **Android ViewModel**
* **Coroutines**
* **Navigation Compose**
